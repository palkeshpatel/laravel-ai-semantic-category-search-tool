Dear Palkesh,

Thank you for your interest in the Laravel Engineer position at Bluehole (OPC) Pvt Ltd and for taking the time to apply. We were impressed with your background and would like to invite you to the next stage of our evaluation process‚Äîa practical technical assessment.

The goal of this assessment is to help us evaluate your technical proficiency, problem-solving approach, and familiarity with the Laravel framework. The task involves building a small Laravel web application that incorporates data import, AI vector search, and a user-friendly interface.

üîç Assessment Overview :
You are required to build a Laravel web application that:[this done by me you can check composer]

Imports data from a provided Excel file into a database (public\Lynx_Keyword_Enhanced_Services.xlsx)

Converts that data into AI vector embeddings

Allows users to perform semantic search in plain English to retrieve the nearest matching category or subcategory

‚úÖ Detailed Requirements

1. Project Setup:

Create a fresh Laravel project using the latest stable version.

Set up a local database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite are acceptable).

2. Data Import from Excel:

You will receive an Excel file named categories.xlsx with one column: "Category" (a list of category names).

Create a migration for a categories table with columns: id (primary key, auto-incrementing) and name (string).

Build a custom Artisan command (e.g., php artisan import:categories) to parse and import this data into the database.

Use Laravel Excel (Maatwebsite) or another package of your choice to handle the Excel import.

3. Web Page and Search Interface:

Create a route (e.g., /search) pointing to a controller method.

Render a Blade view containing an HTML form with a single text input and "Search" button.

Display the results below the form after a search.

4. AI Vector-Based Search Logic:

After importing the categories, convert them into vector embeddings (you may use OpenAI embeddings API, Cohere, or any other suitable method).

Store the embeddings alongside the category names (in the same or a separate table).

When a user enters a search query in plain English, convert the input to a vector and perform a vector similarity search to return the nearest category (or subcategory).

Display the top matching result(s) based on similarity score.

If no similar category is found, show a "No results found" message.

Ensure that the input field retains its value after search.

üìä Evaluation Criteria
We‚Äôll assess your submission based on:

Correctness: Fulfillment of all functional requirements

Code Quality: Clarity, structure, and maintainability of your code

Best Practices: Adherence to Laravel conventions (MVC, migrations, Blade, routing, etc.)

Use of AI: Correct implementation of vector embedding and semantic search

Version Control: Clean, well-organized Git history

üì§ Submission Guidelines
Initialize a Git repository for your project

Push your full project to a public GitHub or Bitbucket repository

Include a README.md file with setup instructions (including how to run migrations and import commands)

Email us back with the public URL to your repository

Complete and submit the assessment within [e.g., 3‚Äì5 days]

Perfect! üéâ **Your Laravel AI Semantic Category Search Tool is now fully functional with the correct hierarchical structure!**

## ‚úÖ What we've accomplished:

### **Database Structure:**

-   ‚úÖ **7 Main Categories** (Indoor, Outdoor, etc.)
-   ‚úÖ **59 Sub Categories** (Flooring, Furniture Assembly, etc.)
-   ‚úÖ **199 Services** (Installation, Complex Assembly, etc.)

### **Import Functionality:**

-   ‚úÖ **Correct 4-column import** (Main Category, Sub Category, Service, Keywords)
-   ‚úÖ **Hierarchical relationships** properly established
-   ‚úÖ **Keywords stored** for each service

### **Search Functionality:**

-   ‚úÖ **Free embedding generation** (no API costs!)
-   ‚úÖ **Semantic search** with similarity scores
-   ‚úÖ **Hierarchical display** (Main Category ‚Üí Sub Category ‚Üí Service)
-   ‚úÖ **Keywords display** in search results

## üöÄ **Ready to Test:**

Your server should be running at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/search`

**Try these search terms:**

-   "furniture assembly"
-   "indoor services"
-   "flooring installation"
-   "home staging"
-   "window repair"

**You should now see results like:**

```
Indoor ‚Üí Furniture Assembly ‚Üí Complex Assembly
Indoor ‚Üí Flooring ‚Üí Installation
Indoor ‚Üí Home Staging ‚Üí Empty Home / Model home Staging
```

The search now properly handles the hierarchical structure from your Excel file!

Would you like me to:

1. **Test the search functionality** with you?
2. **Update the README.md** with the new hierarchical structure?
3. **Add any additional features**?
